# CECS_COMP2020
These projects aim for helping VinUniversity students understand thoroughly the knowledge in Computer Organization.

## Project 1: ALU Design
In this project, I am designing a RISC-V ALU. RISC-V is an instruction set architecture (ISA) that defines the functions a computer can carry out through assembly instructions. An ALU, or arithmetic and logic unit, performs many of the core computations dictated by those instructions. So in short, I will be building a key component of a CPU.

## Project 2: RISC-V Processor
In this project, I will implement a single-cycle processor in Logisim. Your processor will support a small subset of the RISCV instruction set, including arithmetic, logic and memory operations.

## Project 4: RISC-V Interpreter
In this project, I will be implementing a (partial) RISCV interpreter in C. The interpreter will support a subset of the instructions that I implemented in Logisim in P2, as well as memory instructions.

## Project 5: Build a Cache
In this assignment, I will write a performance simulator: a C program that simulates the behavior of a cache. Software performance simulators are used to explore cache designs because they are faster to implement and modify than circuit level simulators (like Logisim, for example). The simulator will be configurable so that it can model the behavior of a variety of cache configurations as well as a variety of coherence protocols.
